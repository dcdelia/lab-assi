# RottenPotatoes with Associations

_This assignment is based on materials **generously** provided by Prof. Armando Fox._

In this assignment, you'll experiment with [OmniAuth](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth) to allow users to use Single Sign-on (SSO) to sign in with third-party credentials, avoiding the hassle of managing passwords yourselves in your app. Youl will replace the hard-wired login mechanism for RottenPotatoes that we implemented in the past assignment on Rails associations with a GitHub-based sign-in mechanism. 

The set of steps to cover are as follows:

* [Part 1:](Part1.md) Set up an application for "Login with GitHub" using the OmniAuth gem.
* [Part 2:](Part2.md) Handling authentication actions with a dedicated `SessionController`.
* [Part 3:](Part3.md) Extend RottenPotatoes to have such authenticated users become Moviegoers.

### Prerequisites
You can start with the RottenPotatoes instance developed for the assignment on Rails associations.
